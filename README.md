# Anki-WaniKani-Hints

Integrates with [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com) API to add mouseover/on-hover "tips" for what radicals make up a kanji, as well as meaning/reading mnemonics for kanji and vocabulary. Utilizes (generated) local json cache to avoid duplicate queries and drastically increase speed.

## Installation

### AnkiWeb (package)
1. Go to https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1622071232
2. Follow the instructions in the "Download" section

### Manual (from source)
1. Clone/download this repository
2. Copy this repository's root directory into your Anki add-ons directory 
    * Directory can be located in Tools->Add-ons by clicking "View Files"

## Usage
1. Go into the configuration options
    * In Tools->Add-ons, select this add-on, then click "Config"
2. Set the "token" option to a valid WaniKani API token (in double-quotes)
    * Can be generated with a free WaniKani account within Account->Settings->API Tokens on their [website](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/personal_access_tokens)
    * Other config options detailed in [config.md](config.md)
3. Add the filters corresponding to `kanji_filter` and/or `vocab_filter` to your card templates
    * For example, with the default value of `kanji_filter`, if you want to add a hint to a field named "Kanji", replace `{{Kanji}}` in your card template with `{{wk-kanji-hint:Kanji}}`
4. Restart Anki and once you review a card containing the filter, hover your mouse over the relevant field to view the tip.
    * Non-fatal errors (such as querying a non-existant vocabulary) are printed to stdout if Anki is run via the command-line

## FAQ
* *Why do I need to use my own API token?*
    * "You may not share API tokens to exceed WaniKaniâ€™s rate limitations." - [WaniKani Terms of Service](https://www.wanikani.com/terms#g-api-terms).
    *  Despite this, **absolutely none** of your personal WaniKani account information is utilized or gathered by this add-on.
* *Do I need a WaniKani subscription to fully use this add-on?*
    * No. All data used by this add-on can be accessed as a free user (or even as a guest) through website endpoints (e.g. https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E8%8C%B6 , https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%81%8A%E8%8C%B6)
* *Why does rendering a new card take a long time?*
    * Hint data is dynamically pulled from the WaniKani API the first time a relevant radical/kanji/vocabulary demands it.
    * Querying the API takes some time, usually a few seconds, but can vary depending on network factors.
    * Hint data is cached locally within `user_files/cache.json` (automatically generated on first run) such that the API does not need to be queried on subsequent uses of the same hint data, therefore saving time.
    * As you continue to use the add-on, the ratio of cache pulls to API pulls should gradually increase and eventually become a non-issue.
* *Why not store all the hint data locally initially?*
    * This would require downloading the entire WaniKani API beforehand and then storing it in this repository. As I do not own that data, it feels wrong to do so (and is probably a violation of their terms).
    * By dynamically pulling from the API, the newest version of the data can be accessed.
* *How do I customize how the tips look?*
    * See [config.md](config.md).
